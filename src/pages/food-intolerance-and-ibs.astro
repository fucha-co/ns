        Food intolerances and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are better recognised and more commonly diagnosed than ever
        before. Symptoms from foods can emerge at any stage of life, even from foods you previously tolerated! Signs of
        food intolerance include: Bloating Urgent bowel motions Loose stools or diarrhoea Constipation or incomplete
        stool evacuation Excessive flatulence Unsettled stomach Lower abdominal pain Frequent headaches, migraines,
        itchy skin and/or year-round nasal congestion If you relate to the above you may like to self-refer, or may have
        been referred by a gastroenterologist or GP for irritable bowel syndrome. Our dietitians work with you to
        determine which foods are an issue for you and which foods you can continue to eat freely. This process might
        involve a period of food elimination, which is only ever temporary. We provide you with step by step, easy to
        follow guidelines and keep in regular contact with you to make the food elimination phase stress free. We then
        guide you through the reintroduction phase to identify which foods cause you symptoms and how much you can
        safely eat to keep your symptoms well-managed. Our end-goal is to leave you feeling empowered and in control of
        your symptoms.
