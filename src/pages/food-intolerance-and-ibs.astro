        If you relate to the above you may like to self-refer, or you may have been referred by a gastroenterologist or GP for irritable bowel syndrome. Our dietitians are Monash FODMAP trained  work with you to
        determine which foods are an issue for you and which foods you can continue to eat freely. This process might
        involve a period of food elimination, which is only ever temporary. 
        <br><br>
        We provide you with step by step, easy to
        follow guidelines and keep in regular contact with you to make the food elimination phase stress free. We then
        guide you through the reintroduction phase to identify which foods cause you symptoms and how much you can
        safely eat to keep your symptoms well-managed. Our end-goal is to leave you feeling empowered and in control of
        your symptoms.
